        "Collaborative filtering is a technique that helps filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. In this article I show a simple example of using item-based filtering applied to a movies data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "<h3>Introduction</h3>\n",
        "\n",
        "  The idea is to develop a movie recommender that shows five the nearest movies to a selected movie. Since data about movies genres is available, we can also add filtering by genres. However, first it doesn't hurt to provide a little introduction about what collaborative filtering is.\n",
        "There are two main types of collaborative filtering - user-based and item-based. Item based means that for item, which wasn't rated by user, rating is calculated based on ratings of similar items given by user. Vice versa, user-based means that rating for a certain item not rated by user is calclated based on ratings of similar users for this item.\n",
        "\n",
        "Item-based collaborative filtering was developed by Amazon. Advantages of item-based filtering:\n",
        "- item-based filtering is faster and more stable when there are more users than items. The reason is that usually, the average rating received by an item doesn’t change as quickly as the average rating given by a user to different items. \n",
        "- item-based filtering performs better when the ratings matrix is sparse - it has many null values.\n",
        "\n",

        "<h3>Basic concept</h3>\n",
        "\n",
        "Detailed description of item-based collaborative filtering is provided in [this article.](https://towardsdatascience.com/item-based-collaborative-filtering-in-python-91f747200fab)\n",
        "To briefly explain how collaborative filtering works, a good way is do imagine a small table, where rows are movies, columns are users, a value on intersection of rows and columns is a rating, which were given to a movie by a user. Since there's no situation in real life when all users rated all movies, table contains some null values which should be filled.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fundamental assumption for this method is that a user gives similar ratings to similar movies. 'Similarity' can be estimated in a different ways. For example, euclidean distance or cosine similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cosine similarity uses cosine of an angle to measure the distance between two vectors. Vectors of ratings for one movie are constructed using ratings of all users. We need to measure an angle between two movies vectors. As angle increases, cosine (= similarity) decreases. \n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, to calculate rating for not rated movie, we calculate weighted average of ratings given to items which we consider the most similar. The more cosine similarity value is, the more weight should be given to rating of item used for estimation.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can determine number of the closest items to the estimated one by ourselves, using K- nearest neighbors algorithm. The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other. So, we use KNN algorithm with cosine similarity metrics and pass as a parameter a number of neighbors."
